# TWD Wrapped
TWD Wrapped is our version of Spotify Wrapped. It contains data from our Spotify accounts such as most listened songs and artists, when do we listen to the music the most, how long do we listen to a song and proprtion of skipped songs. Our dashboard also allows to compare our listening habits and show which songs we both liked. \
